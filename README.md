# Identity

This is the stage one task for the HNG10 mobile track internship. the name "identity" was chosen because it relates with the task. 

Identity was built with the flutter (version 3.13.1) framework of the Dart programming language. It also has a SDK of '>=3.1.0 <4.0.0' and an external dependency called "Webview_flutter ^4.2.4" which was used to redirect the github link of this profile to the webview page.

To succcessfully clone this project, ensure you have the flutter version 3.0 or greater and a SDK greater than 3.0 else it will lead to errors while running your dependencies.

## Assumptions
Since there was no specific name given for the App, it was named identity by me. 

The home page of the app consists of an AppBar with the title "Tech ORB" pronounced "Tech HUB". Tech ORB (Olatunji Ruth Blessing) is a response to the first requirement of the task which says that "The application's main screen should prominently display your slack name". I wasn't sure which of the names was referred to (The real name or the display name) because it was said that we should use a unique name, so points will not be awarded to someone else. This is the reason for Tech ORB as i believe it is unique. However, my name on slack is Olatunji Ruth.
